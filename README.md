# Trackmania Markdown Notes Plugin

Lets you write notes with markdown formatting that display during gameplay. Notes can be saved.

Made for Trackmania (2020) with [Openplanet](https://openplanet.dev/)'s modding APIs.

## Todo

- Add option to save multiple notes and restore more than one note
- I'm open to suggestions, leave them as [issues](https://github.com/Reinachan/Trackmania-Markdown-Notes/issues)
